ABOUT RAJVENKADAM AND HIS PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

INTRODUCTION
Hey there — I’m Rajvenkadam.
Developer | Designer | Forever Learner.

I am a passionate software developer specializing in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). My journey in tech began with curiosity about how websites work, and today that curiosity has evolved into a mission to build meaningful digital products that solve real-world problems. I believe in continuous learning, embracing challenges, and turning ideas into execution.

ABOUT THE WEBSITE
This portfolio website is a reflection of my skills, journey, and growth in technology. It features a clean, modern glassmorphic UI with responsive design, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes an AI-powered chatbot built using Python and Flask, making the experience interactive and personalized.

Key features:

Hero introduction section

About page covering background and vision

Skills section for technical and non-technical strengths

Store page with projects, certificates, and achievements

Integrated AI chatbot

Mobile-friendly, responsive layout

The goal of this website is to serve as a central hub for collaborators, recruiters, and anyone interested in my work.

PERSONAL JOURNEY
My tech journey began with a simple question: “How does a website work?” I had no formal mentor or training, so I explored, experimented, and learned through curiosity and mistakes. Debugging became my teacher, and building became my method of learning.

Today, I actively develop websites, applications, UI designs, and AI-assisted tools. Every error is an opportunity to learn faster, build smarter, and improve. If something is new to me, I don’t avoid it — I learn it and build with it.

I am open to internships, freelance work, and collaboration opportunities.
